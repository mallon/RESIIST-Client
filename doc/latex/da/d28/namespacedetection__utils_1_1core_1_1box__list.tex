\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyVerb}Bounding Box List definition.

BoxList represents a list of bounding boxes as tensorflow
tensors, where each bounding box is represented as a row of 4 numbers,
[y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max].  It is assumed that all bounding boxes
within a given list correspond to a single image.  See also
box_list_ops.py for common box related operations (such as area, iou, etc).

Optionally, users can add additional related fields (such as weights).
We assume the following things to be true about fields:
* they correspond to boxes in the box_list along the 0th dimension
* they have inferrable rank at graph construction time
* all dimensions except for possibly the 0th can be inferred
  (i.e., not None) at graph construction time.

Some other notes:
  * Following tensorflow conventions, we use height, width ordering,
  and correspondingly, y,x (or ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax) ordering
  * Tensors are always provided as (flat) [N, 4] tensors.
